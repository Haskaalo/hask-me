## Visit us!
Hello! Our website is running [here](https://hask.me/)

## What am I using?
I'm currently using [semantic-ui](http://semantic-ui.com/) for CSS, [request](https://github.com/request/request) to get Stats, [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and of course... [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## To do list

1. Make design better
2. Make stats.js a little bit better (currently using document.GetElementById)
3. Making OWAPI run on our own server
4. Match History?
